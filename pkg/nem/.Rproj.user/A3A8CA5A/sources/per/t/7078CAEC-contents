\title{
Generates equally distributed random points on a sphere
}
\description{
It is used to generate random points on a circumference (two dimensions) or on a sphere (three dimentions) ... The points are more equally distributed as in the case of other approaches.
}
\usage{
ersphere(n, dim, acc, signs)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{n}{the number of points to be generated}
  \item{dim}{the number of dimensions/variables}
  \item{acc}{the precision (the number of proposed generated points)}
  \item{signs}{the signs of the generated variables; set a vector with 1s or -1s where each element corresponds to one variable/dimension; e.g., if the points in two dimensional space are going to be generated, then the vector with two elements can be provided. If the first element would be 1 and the second element would be -1, then all values in the fist column will be positive, while all the values in the second column will be negative; if you do not care about the signs of all variables, then set \code{signs=NULL} (privzeto); if you do not care about the sign of only one variable, then set the corresponding element \code{signs} to \code{NA}}
  \item{initial.points}{provide a matrix with the previusly generated points if you only want to add/generated some new/additional ones}
}
