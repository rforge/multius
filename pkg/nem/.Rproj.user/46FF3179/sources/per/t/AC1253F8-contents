\title{
Ordered clusters in a matrix network representation 2
}
\description{
This function reorder the groups in an image matrix in such a way that the blocks with a higher average weigh are placed on the left hand side of the matrix.
}
\usage{
orderdIM(net, res)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{net}{Original network of class \code{matrix}.}
  \item{res}{An object of type \code{list}, containing partition \code{clu} (it can be obtained by using \code{clu(res)} where \code{res} is an object produced by the function \code{oprRandParC} from \code{blockmodeling} package) and image matrix \code{IM} (it can be obtained by using \code{IM(res)} where \code{res} is an object produced by the function \code{oprRandParC} from \code{blockmodeling} package).
